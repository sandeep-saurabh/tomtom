Problem Statement
Given Satellite imagery, extract road feature from it

# Dataset Location
https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/data/

# About Dataset
The Data is split in two categories Training, Validation and Test. Each input image is in RGB format and its associated label is in binary format. Label with pixel value 1 represent road element and with pixel value 0 represent non-road elements

# Evaluation metrics
Intersection over union (IoU) of the positive (road) class, Accuracy, i.e., the percentage of correctly classified pixels, Precision and Recall

# Submission
